            <p>If you’ve been on social media recently, you’ve most likely stumbled upon a post discussing web3, cryptocurrency, maybe even the metaverse and NFTs, begging you to join the next big thing—the internet revolution of our lifetime. But what exactly do these terms represent?</p>
            <p>Coined in 2014, Web 3.0 is a term used to describe the next generation of the internet, and possibly a new era in society as a whole. To believers, the concept is one of vastly improved online security and autonomy, free from the digital tyranny of governments and large corporations who are able to control information and harvest user data as they wish. Web 3 would overturn the current internet that we are all so familiar with, and affect everything from games to social media, possibly even online banking. You might be thinking, “I’m happy with the internet as it is? Why does it have to change?” To understand the reasoning behind web 3, we need to understand the history of the internet.</p>
            <h2>How We Got Here</h2>
            <p>The first generation of the modern web was introduced by Tim Berners-Lee in 1989, and is also known as the “Hypertext Web”. It was based on Berners-Lee’s desire to be able to access any information from anywhere at any time. As such, one would navigate this web through a series of hyperlinks, transporting you from document to document. Later, libraries of links would be created, but this web lacked the search engines, like Google, that we can’t live without. Web 1.0 was read only--while anybody that was tech savvy enough could upload, content was generally only posted by experts and the companies that hired them. The static nature of Web 1.0 made user interactions virtually impossible.</p>
            <p>Then in 2004 came Web 2.0, the “Social Web”, which advanced the capabilities and accessibility of the internet, especially for the average user. This version implemented writable data, meaning that one could edit the content of a webpage from their own browser. The underlying tech also enabled two-way and group communication, leading to modern social media. Webpages became more organized  with the emergence of search engines like Google and Safari. Many of these functions were made possible by big corporations and their ability to store all the data in centralized servers, but users are coming to realize that this dependence is becoming unhealthy for the web and the people. </p>
            <p>Finally, there’s Web 3.0, an ongoing effort to transform the structure of the current web into one that is more secure, verifiable, and self-governing. Web 3.0 aims to address the underlying issues of Web 2.0, most of which are related to its centralized nature. With everyone at the mercy of big tech companies, one server crash can put millions of users out of contact with each other, and one data breach can expose the information of many. In addition, companies themselves often sell their users’ data for profit. They also have the ability to control what information the public has access to and sell ads as they see fit. Recently, Facebook has been targeted by the government for <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/10/12/congress-regulate-facebook-algorithm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">prioritizing ad revenue over safety and truth</a>, as well as being a host for <a href="https://www.newsnationnow.com/business/tech/facebook-human-trafficking/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">human traffickers</a>.</p>
            <h2>How Does Web 3.0 Work?</h2>
            <p>The structure of Web 3.0 is based on <a href="https://101blockchains.com/ultimate-blockchain-technology-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blockchain technology</a>, allowing the network to function on peer-to-peer (computer to computer) connections, rather than running wholly on a central server. On this network, each computer (also known as a node) handles a small fraction of the computing power to enable processing and communication.</p>
            <p>When a node enters the network, they receive a full copy of the blockchain. In the event that a new block is added, nodes on the network will verify it using a process called proof of work. Proof of work is essentially a computational problem that isn’t very difficult to solve, but works due to the fact that all the nodes must agree on the answer. When a consensus is reached, the new block can be published. If a hacker wanted to alter blocks on the blockchain, they would first have to change all the blocks on the chain such that the chain of data matches the altered block. They would then have to redo the proof of work for the altered block and its successors, and finally, take control of more than 50% of the nodes on the network in order to force a consensus. This arduous process makes the data on the blockchain secure. When proof of work is done on a cryptocurrency network in particular, this is called mining, and the network will reward the miners with a small amount of currency as an incentive.</p>
            <p>A basic analogy for blockchain is as follows: Say we are in the classroom, and Dave has a marker. He decides to give the marker to Jane and writes “Dave to Jane” on the whiteboard. Everyone else also saves their own copy of the whiteboard in their notebooks. Jane decides to give the marker to Owen through the same process. But, Hunter decides he wants the marker and tries to steal it from Owen. However, “Jane to Owen” is still on the whiteboard, and there is no “Owen to Hunter” transaction. Everyone else (the nodes) bore witness to this, and agrees that Owen is the current owner of the marker.</p>
            <p>After some thinking, Hunter still wants to steal the marker, but he decides to go to the whiteboard and change “Dave to Jane” and make it “Dave to Owen” when nobody's looking. He then edited “Jane to Owen” to “Owen to Hunter”. However, everybody has their own copy of the blockchain in their notebooks, and unanimously agrees that the whiteboard is incorrect. It is corrected, and Owen gets to keep his marker.</p>
            <h2>How Can Blockchain Be Used?</h2>
            <p>Given that blockchain is essentially a series of time stamped and verified groups of information, blockchain can be used to send data, money, other digital assets, as well as contracts between nodes. All of this can be done independent of a middleman due to the system being decentralized and self-governing. Currently, there are many projects emerging with a variety of uses. DeFi, or decentralized finance, is one. Users can send cryptocurrency to one another without the interference of a bank. They can choose to pick a coin with protocols and a group of developers they trust. If they don’t want to risk the volatility of typical cryptocurrency, they can send stablecoins--privately issued crypto that holds the value of a backing currency like the U.S. Dollar.</p>
            <p>In the digital asset space, non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are becoming increasingly popular. NFT is technically any non-interchangeable unit of data that is verified on the blockchain, but is most commonly used when talking about verified digital art or items. One project that has gained undeniable popularity is the <a href="https://boredapeyachtclub.com/#/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC)</a>, created by the four online pseudonyms Gargamel, Gordon Goner, Emperor Tomato Ketchup and No Sass in late April of 2021. At the time of writing, the cheapest Ape is selling for 50.53 Ethereum, or almost 205 thousand U.S. dollars.</p>
            <p>With only 10,000 of these digital Apes in circulation, each one holds more value than just its price tag. Owning an Ape grants you access to the “Club”, netting you an NFT and some passive income every time the group releases a new project. Recently, BAYC also hosted a party at Brooklyn Steel, with a couple hundred tickets up for grabs on a first-come-first-serve basis for the club members. In addition to your everyday tech bro, some owners of Bored Apes include Jimmy Fallon, Post Malone, Steph Curry, and Mark Cuban.</p>
            <p>NFTs have a variety of practical applications other than being a way to show off your internet goods. Being able to verify digital items opens up opportunities for artists to auction their art digitally, or sell directly to a buyer. On March 11, 2021, Mike Winkelmann--a digital artist known as Beeple--auctioned a piece for $69 million at <a href="https://www.christies.com/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Christie's</a>. Musicians could also sell their songs and albums as NFTs instead of posting them on a 3rd party platform like Spotify. The digital nature of NFTs means it is more than capable of playing sound on your phone or computer. One possibility is the integration of NFTs and music services, where you can link the ownership of your NFT and listen to it on your favorite music app.</p>
            <p>An extension of NFTs is blockchain gaming. Many groups are developing apps and games that live on the blockchain (aka decentralized apps, or Dapps), which can be used to perform player authentication without having to store login data in centralized servers. Being blockchain-based means no downtime caused by server failure. Many of these games also reward players with NFTs in lieu of the typical digital items and currency you might find. The latter two are a mark of prestige in game, but are rarely exchangeable for real world currency. Awarding crypto and NFTs to players allows them to not only be owners of unique items, but also sell these items to other players for real cash. The blockchain authentication system opens the possibility of being able to have just one character that is transferable to many games across the network. This is the basis of the metaverse.</p>
            <p>The metaverse is a digital world where players can show off their items, build houses, own virtual land, and interact with other players. They can transport their avatar to a variety of worlds and games. A pretty great comparison is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ready_Player_One_(film)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ready Player One</a>, where we see the characters able to socialize and play many games within the same network. There are a variety of existing projects, both <a href="https://thevrsoldier.com/top-5-hottest-metaverse-projects-right-now/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">non-VR</a>, and ones that are virtual reality compatible, such as <a href="https://victoriavr.com/our-vision/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Victoria VR</a>. The idea is gaining significant momentum. Live trailers are already posted, and even big names like Mark Zuckerberg are preparing for the metaverse. Zuckerberg recently renamed Facebook to <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/10/facebook-company-is-now-meta/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Meta</a>, aiming to condense the brand’s existing technologies and bring the metaverse to life.</p>
            <h2>Some Setbacks to Web 3.0</h2>
            <p>Despite the exciting possibilities, there are certain hurdles the movement must overcome before becoming a reality. One of these is general opinion. While the community has a strong backing of avid users, the general public remains wary, seeing cryptocurrency in particular as a way for the rich to make absurd amounts of money.</p>
            <p>In addition, companies like Apple and Google have cracked down on mining apps, and web 3.0 has attracted the suspicion of governments worldwide. In the U.S. reconciliation bill, cryptocurrency is one of the addressed topics. It vaguely includes regulating crypto on a national level, but experts are skeptical. The currency financial regulatory framework was developed for 20th century banking and would likely fail to meet the needs of the 21st century digital space. Experts would need to work closely with legislators to help them understand current technology in order to align their goals regarding new tech and promote innovation. The good news is that if this happens, government regulation of digital assets need not be adversarial.</p>
            <p>Finally, mining has undeniably high <a href="https://gizmodo.com/e-waste-from-a-single-bitcoin-transaction-is-like-throw-1847700896" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">energy and resource consumption</a> levels. The reality is that mining rigs have short lifespans, containing ASIC chips that are on average replaced every 1.29 years. Currently, the Bitcoin network goes through 30.7 metric kilotons of equipment annually, an amount similar to the small IT and telecommunication waste of the Netherlands.</p>
            <p>In terms of electricity, proof of work is an extremely intensive computational process and consumes high amounts of energy. <a href="https://digiconomist.net/bitcoin-energy-consumption/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bitoin's carbon footprint</a> is comparable to that of a small country. One study shows that Bitcoin emitted 69 million metric tons of CO2 in 2017, while only being used for 0.033% of cashless transactions. The study finds that Bitcoin could be responsible for a global increase in temperature of 2-3℃ in the future. However, experts say the study is flawed, and wrongly assumes that future energy sources will be the same as they are today. It ignores shifts towards renewable energy, and that decarbonizing the energy sector will decarbonize crypto mining.</p>
            <h2>Is Web 3.0 the Future? Is the Hype Real?</h2>
            <p>With promises of increased anonymity and privacy, the ability to sell a drawing of an ape for cash, and a virtual presence that we’ve so far only seen in movies, it’s extremely easy to get excited about what the future holds for Web 3. However, we should keep in mind that the actual implementation of such functions have yet to be widely adopted.</p>
            <p>Many internet users range from ignorant to apathetic towards Web 3. A significant portion are resistant to the changes that it might bring, claiming NFTs and crypto are <a href="https://time.com/nextadvisor/investing/cryptocurrency/common-crypto-scams/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">scams</a>. In fact, these claims hold a degree of truth: in this largely unregulated space, it’s extremely easy for a slightly unobservant victim to be taken advantage of. This makes crypto seem extremely unattractive compared to conventional banking, where an illegal credit card charge can be remedied with a single phone call.</p>
            <p>Others have doubts about the technology behind Web 3. One main complaint involves the scalability of blockchain. Updates on the blockchain must be broadcast to all the nodes in the network, consuming vast amounts of resources. On the more popular networks, processing transactions requires a “gas fee”, paid by the user, to incentivize nodes to prioritize the proof of work for that transaction. On a network like Ethereum, gas fees during peak activity can cost anywhere from hundreds to thousands of dollars. However, there are some <a href="https://101blockchains.com/blockchain-scalability-solutions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">solutions</a> that would significantly improve user experiences.</p>
            <p>Despite the challenges, Web 3 undeniably has momentum. The community has a growing online presence, with headlines making their way into major news outlets like <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/11/21/1056988346/web3-internet-jargon-or-future-vision" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NPR</a> and the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/jack-dorsey-and-the-unlikely-revolutionaries-who-want-to-reboot-the-internet-11639803654" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wall Street Journal</a>. Corporations, regardless of their stance on the topic, are aware of this movement, as evidenced by Meta and the crypto section in the reconciliation bill. The odds are that Web 3 integrations will slowly make their way into the devices and apps we use on a daily basis and firmly become a part of our lives, but how far future implementation will veer from the current ideal is yet to be seen.</p>
