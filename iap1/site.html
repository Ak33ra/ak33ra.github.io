                In the year 1848, a series of political upheavals known as the Revolutions of 1848 spread throughout Europe, and remains the most widespread revolutionary movement in Europe’s history.
            </p>
            <p>
                These revolutions began due to culminating frustrations, such as limited voting rights and government participation, in combination with issues caused by crop failures in 1846 and the industrial revolution. Largely liberal in nature, the movements aimed to bring down monarchical governments and create independent nation-states. Although most of Europe was affected, each revolution was independent of the rest.
            </p>
            <p>
                Most of these uprisings were led by temporary unions between the middle and working classes, gaining significant momentum, and in many cases, forcing elites to cede to their demands. However, even after being temporarily successful, the majority of the Revolutions of 1848 crumbled. Why is that?
            </p>
            <p>
                The ingredients necessary for a successful revolution can be summarized in the following five points:
            </p>
            <pre>
    - A severe political crisis that paralyzes the state’s administrative and coercive capabilities
    - Mass frustration resulting in popular uprisings
    - A permissive or tolerant world context- outside governments don’t intervene
    - Dissident elites to shepherd movements
    - Unifying motivations for revolution that cut across major classes
            </pre>
            <p>
                We’ll take a short look at how five countries satisfied these requirements, and how they shaped the path of that country’s revolution.
            </p>
            <h1 id = "Italy">Italy</h1>
            <p>
                At the time, the Congress of Vienna was ineffective at creating a Post-Napoleonic Italy. The territory was split into 10 different kingdoms, 5 controlled by the Habsburgs, 2 by the Bourbons, and 1 by the Pope. However, the people desired a unified Italy, which began a movement generally known as Risorgimento. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The first insurrection began in Palermo on January 9, 1848, leading several rulers, such as Charles Albert of Sardinia-Piedmont, to grant a more liberal constitution. Charles Albert began to liberalize his government, earning popularity among the people. 
            </p>
            <p>
                On the other hand, the Austrian government resisted popular pressure, suppressing demonstrations throughout its territory. War was declared between Metternich (Austria) and Charles Albert, eventually leading to Charles Albert’s loss and exile after the Pope rescinded his support.

            <p>
                In France, the middle and lower classes were dissatisfied with their representation in government and limited suffrage. In addition, lower classes were hungry and lacking jobs, and felt that their opportunities to gain wealth were extremely limited, and the culmination of these factors led to rising tensions in France.
            </p>
            <p>
                The fuze ran out when Louis-Philippe and his minister, Guizot, passed a ban on banquets in response to liberal gatherings throughout the country. The government was paralyzed during the following insurrections, both due to the National Guard’s defection and lingering fear from the French Revolution in 1789.
            </p>
            <p>
                As a result, Louis-Philippe abdicated the throne, and prominent liberals among the Chamber of Deputies formed the Provisional Government, and promised the people a liberal constitution. This would later become known as the Second Republic.
            </p>
            <p>
                Despite being a temporary success, the Second Republic was rather short-lived. With its hands tied in France’s bad financial state, conservatives had time to rally and do public demonstrations. Eventually, the Party of Order would be created. Conservatives from this party would be voted into the government, and eventually Louis-Napoleon would be elected as president and self-stage a coup, disbanding the Second Republic and being crowned emperor.

                Sparked by news of success in Paris, the diet of lower Austria demanded the resignation of Metternich, who fled to London. After his resignation, Hungary began introducing policies that didn’t agree with the Vienna ministry and threatened the monarchy. Furthermore, Hungary refused to aid Austria in the current conflict against Italy and Charles Albert, though this would still end with Italy’s loss.
            </p>
            <p>
                After the Italian revolts were dealt with, Austria turned its focus to Hungary, dissolving the Hungarian Parliament and sanctioning invasion into Hungary. A series of revolts in Vienna in support of Hungary temporarily commanded the attention of Austria and Croatia, though these were quickly dealt with. Russian aid was requested by Austria, and Hungary eventually surrendered.

            <p>
                Like Italy at the time, Germany was a collection of many smaller states, though the people desired for its unification. The two major classes in this revolution were the small bourgeoisie, who were dissatisfied by limits put on capitalism, and the working class, who demanded universal suffrage and civil liberties. They wanted to be free from heavy taxation and political censorship. Like the rest of Europe, the working classes in Germany were also hungry, and sporadic hunger riots were already taking place across Germany. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The news that Louis-Philippe had lost the throne sparked excitement and insurrections in Germany. With the recent resignation of Metternich, Austrian princes were scared and appointed prominent liberals to government positions to appease the masses, and the Frankfurt National Assembly was created as a means to politically unify Germany.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Assembly soon met and began to prepare a constitution, however too much time passed, allowing the conservatives to regain support and achieve a series of victories. In the end, the revolution was completely crushed by the summer of 1849.
            </p>
            <h1 id = "Spain">Spain</h1>
            <p>
                A situation that continues to puzzle historians is the fact that, despite the unrest in Europe, Spain did not have a revolution. Ripe for rebellion, there was popular opposition to its rule, and the monarchy and church were both weak.
            </p>
            <p>
                On February 28, 1848, dictatorial powers were granted to General Narvaez, who suspended Cortes (meaning Court in Spanish, similar to Parliament), receiving strong opposition from progressives and the large middle class. Being an extremely unstable country faced with the same financial problems as the rest of Europe and fitting all of the five criteria for a successful revolution, it’s a wonder that no revolution occurred.

                It’s worth noting that the four revolutions discussed were temporary successes, but ultimately ended in failure. Why is that?
            </p>
            <p>
                In Italy’s case, failure was mostly due to lack of unification after the Pope removed himself from the situation, turning the tides of the conflict. The revolutionaries were likely too entranced by their ideals as well, which included abolishing taxes, which would leave no way to raise funds for the government. 
            </p>
            <p>
                France’s eventual failure stemmed from several factors, the first of which being France’s economic situation. As with many other countries, France’s finances were a mess and required most of the Provisional Government’s attention, meaning that they failed to address growing conservative powers. More importantly, there was a falling out between the petite bourgeoisie (lower middle class) and the working classes. While they both wanted increased government representation, the working class was unsatisfied at the fact that their share of that representation was extremely limited, leading to tensions between the classes. Without the support of the working class, the petite bourgeoisie’s movements were bound to fail. In addition to this, the National Workshops that provided jobs for Parisians were paid for by the farmers’ taxes, leading to unrest between these two groups.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Hungarian revolution’s failure was for a couple simple reasons: lack of preparation and Russian influence. The Hungarians were not prepared to fight a war and lacked the material resources to do so. Even without external factors, they would have likely lost anyway. The threat posed by the Russians simply expedited the process.
            </p>
            <p>
                The reasons for Germany’s failure are very similar to those of France. On the surface, the Frankfurt Assembly was slow to push forward their constitution, giving the conservatives time to regroup and gather power, both politically and in the military. The Assembly being slow to act was in part due to divisions in the participating groups. The Grossdeutsch movement wanted Austria to play a leading role in the new government, while the Kleindeutsch thought the Habsburgs had too much power to keep the interests of Germany in mind and emphasized that Austria should be included, instead putting Prussia at the helm. Furthermore, the end goals of different economic groups finally revealed themselves; the petite bourgeoisie (business people) of Germany wanted to use their political power to promote capitalism and economic growth, which would include industrialization. Poor and marginalized groups desired protection against mechanized production. Eventually, the people realized the new government would not do any more to solve their problems than the previous one had, and revolutionary vigor died down, eventually allowing Austria to re-seize power.
            </p>
            <p>
                Taking into account the failures of these countries’ revolutions, reasons for failure can be grouped into four major points:
            </p>
            <pre>
    - Failure to meet success criteria
    - Internal struggles
    - Lack of forward thinking
    - Slow to action
            </pre>
            <p>
                These situations show that even though a revolution might appear to meet the success criteria at its debut, a successful revolution is one that carries these criteria through to its end, which proves to be exceedingly difficult. At any time, a variety of factors can influence one of these components, leading to divisions, delays, and unforeseen events that can cause a movement to crumble, even when the illusion of success has already been achieved.
